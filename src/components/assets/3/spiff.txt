Model Name              : Spaceman Spiff v.1.1
installation directory  : quake2/baseq2/players/spiff
Author                  : Christopher L. Bruce (Wrath)
Skin Author		: Myself currently
Email Address           : Ruffiana@hotmail.com

Model description       : Straight from the Sunday comics, Bill "comic god" Watterson's Calvin and Hobbes.  One of many of Calvin's alter-egos.  That intrepid space explorer...SPACEMAN SPIFF!!!

Other info              : This is the near completed Spaceman Spiff, I will hopefully be finishing up the rest of the view weapons within the next week or so.  He is definitly playable, having been tweaked quite a bit since the original release.  The skins are passable, I cannot seem to get a good fleshtone to work in Q2.  If ANYONE would like to redo the skins for Spiff, I would be EXTREMELY grateful, and offer what assistance or resources I can.  

Additional Credits to   : id Software, Bill Watterson, rouge13 and the entire Q2PMP site!

Thanks to               : Staff of Planetquake's Q2PMP, and everyone who has offered helpful advice on the messageboard there.  Thanks to eradicator for his offer of help in doing the skins...wonder what happened to him.
