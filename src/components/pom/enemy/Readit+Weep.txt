Hello! First model for 1999 from Citrus Frog [date is 5/1/1999]

"What the F**k have you done now Citrus!?!"

I've heard this phrase quite a bit after I released the Penguin, well in 
answer to the question: I've made a Big Ol' Scary Smiley Face with Big Teeth,
Cross-Bone array and a Big Fat Stoogie to Suck On.

Or you could just refer to it kindly as 'Smiley'

Unlike all my other models this one has no confusing story line or plot to follow it.
I made this model originally to enter into the Chaos Comics competition. Therefore
it's based upon Evil Ernie's Badge 'Smiley', I never entered it due to problems both 
myself and others were having with the model's skin.
It is also based upon the 'Have a Day' and 'Have a Night' posters by the People over
at Mantis Design. Go say hello to them over at www.mantisd.com.

** UPDATE - 21/1/1999 **

Just an update on the skins front really...

The Model now comes with 3 Ctf skins [Red, Blue and new Green variety] These come from
the skilled pixel brush of Jason "Warlocke" Lewis. As I changed some of the skin mesh I 
had to edit the original skins. All I did was fill in some black areas.

Also Smiley has 4 other New Skins!

Eight Ball - Based on the CTF skins and the Eight Ball in QPong
Slam Dunk - Another QPong influenced Basketball
World - He's got the whole World in his hands, he's got thw whole wide world in his hands..
Number15 - My 'Big Shot' Cue Ball.

All the skins [part from number15] were based upon the skins for the balls in QPong.

** End of All That **  

Made with Q2Modeller and skinned using Npherno's Skin Tool and Paint Shop Pro

Also included in this zip is a fun picture of Citrus Frog's Happy Frag Club Band!
