Editor used             : PSP 5, for palette loading and other stuff.
                          Skinview, one helluva good program!

Time to Create          : pfft.

Little Known Facts      : That's right, they're cue balls.

     Don't take credit for my skins! If you take skins that were 
      THIS EASY to make, and say you made them, you must really 
         suck. So just don't do it, besides, it's bad Karma.
